# <Webpage Accessibility>

## Description

In this project I took an existing webpage and updated the HTML, and subsequently the CSS, to meet accessibility standards. I did this to gain a deeper understanding of both HTML and CSS. This will assist the webpage with search engine optimisation and improves the functionality of accessibility technologies such as screen readers. In doing this I learned about updating and formatting a simple webpage. I also become extremely comfortable with the Git workflow.

## Installation

There are no installation requirements. This will run in a suitable web browser.

## Usage

This is a single page website. The 3 navigation headings link to the relevant section within the page.

## Credits

Existing code and assets provided by BSC in collaboration with Monash University. All updates to code completed by Luke Hunter.


## Features

This is a webpage which now complies with accessibility standards.


## Tests

All links were tested. Issue discovered and fixed with the 'Search Engine Optimisation' link. Pre-existing webpage was then used to ensure that CSS formatting matched the original.
